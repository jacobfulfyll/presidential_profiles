       " 'no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and received on the th day of the present month.',\n",
       " 'on the one hand, i was summoned by my country, whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which i had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years<u+0097>a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time.',\n",
       " 'on the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.',\n",
       " 'in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected.',\n",
       " 'all i dare hope is that if, in executing this task, i have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens, and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me, my error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me, and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated.',\n",
       " 'such being the impressions under which i have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge. in tendering this homage to the great author of every public and private good, i assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow-citizens at large less than either.',\n",
       " 'no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the united states.',\n",
       " 'every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency; and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude, along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage.',\n",
       " 'these reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed.']"
